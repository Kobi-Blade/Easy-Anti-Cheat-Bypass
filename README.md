# Easy Anti-Cheat Bypass
This repository contains a simple Windows batch script, compiled and designed to launch games directly by calling their executable files, bypassing the EAC bootstrapper.

## Usage
- Download the executable for the game you want to bypass.
- Extract the executable into the root folder of the game, replacing EAC bootstrapper.

## Currently supported games
- Lords of the Fallen (2023)

## Notes
This script will not allow you to play online unless the developers provide support for unprotected servers.
